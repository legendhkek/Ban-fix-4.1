        PART 1: CRITICAL BAN-FIXING FUNCTIONS (TOP 20)
================================================================================

These are THE MOST IMPORTANT functions for ban fixing. Patch these first!

================================================================================
OFFSET: 0x00089E54
SIZE: 88 bytes (0x58)
FUNCTION: AntsVoice_Init
TYPE: [AUTH] Authentication & Initialization
PRIORITY: ★★★★★ CRITICAL
================================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
  Main initialization function for the entire voice/authentication system.
  Called once when game starts or voice system activates. Sets up all internal
  structures, loads configuration, and prepares authentication subsystems.

DETAILED BEHAVIOR:
  1. Checks if already initialized (singleton pattern)
  2. Allocates global state structures
  3. Loads configuration from files
  4. Initializes authentication key storage
  5. Sets up network communication handlers
  6. Prepares for server connection
  7. May perform early device/account checks
  8. Returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure

BAN RELEVANCE:
  This is the ENTRY POINT for all authentication. If your account or device
  is severely banned, the system may refuse to initialize entirely. Banned
  accounts/devices can be blocked at this early stage before any network
  communication happens.

WHICH BANS IT FIXES:
  1H:  ★★★   (Helpful but not necessary)
  6H:  ★★★   (Helpful but not necessary)
  1D:  ★★★★  (Very helpful, often combined with ApplyMessageKey)
  3D:  ★★★★  (Very helpful)
  7D:  ★★★★★ (Critical for 7-day+ bans)
  30D: ★★★★★ (Essential)
  1Y:  ★★★★★ (Essential)
  10Y: ★★★★★ (Essential but may not be sufficient alone)
  PERM:☆     (Won't fix permanent bans)
  DEV: ★★★★★ (Essential for device bans)
  
WHEN TO PATCH:
  - 7-day bans and longer
  - Device-level bans
  - When other patches don't work
  - When game crashes or refuses to start on banned device
  - As part of comprehensive ban bypass strategy

WHEN NOT TO PATCH:
  - Short bans (1-hour to 3-day) - use ApplyMessageKey instead
  - If only doing prevention
  - Risk of instability - only if needed

PATCH STRATEGY:
  METHOD 1 - Force Success Return (Recommended):
    Replace first 8 bytes with:
    00 00 80 D2 C0 03 5F D6
    
    ARM64 Assembly:
    MOV W0, #0    ; Return value = 0 (success)
    RET           ; Return immediately
    
    Effect: Function immediately returns success without any checks
    
  METHOD 2 - NOP All Checks:
    Let function run but NOP any conditional branches
    More stable but complex to implement

HEX BYTES:
  Original (First 32 bytes):
  E0 1B 00 F0 FF 43 00 D1 00 40 42 F9 FE 03 00 F9
  80 01 00 B5 C1 0E 00 90 C3 0E 00 90 C4 0E 00 90
  
  Patched (Method 1):
  00 00 80 D2 C0 03 5F D6 1F 20 03 D5 1F 20 03 D5
  [Rest filled with NOPs or unchanged]

VERIFICATION:
  hexdump -C libAntsVoice.so -s 0x89E54 -n 16

RISK LEVEL: Medium-High
  Patching initialization can cause crashes if not done carefully.
  Test thoroughly. Have backup.

SIDE EFFECTS:
  - May skip legitimate initialization steps
  - Could affect voice functionality
  - Test voice chat after patching

COMBINATION PATCHES:
  Always combine with:
  - AntsVoice_ApplyMessageKey (0x8A850)
  - AntsVoice_JoinTeamRoom (0x8A0B4)
  
  For device bans, also combine with:
  - AntsVoice_CheckDeviceMuteState (0x8B6F8)

================================================================================
OFFSET: 0x0008A850
SIZE: 120 bytes (0x78)
FUNCTION: AntsVoice_ApplyMessageKey
TYPE: [AUTH] Primary Authentication
PRIORITY: ★★★★★ CRITICAL - #1 MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION
================================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
  THE PRIMARY AUTHENTICATION FUNCTION. This handles the main authentication
  key exchange with the server. When you try to login or connect to game
  servers, this function sends your credentials and receives the server's
  response about your account status.

DETAILED BEHAVIOR:
  1. Receives authentication key/token as parameter
  2. Validates key format locally
  3. Prepares authentication packet
  4. Sends key to game servers via network
  5. ★★★ SERVER CHECKS YOUR BAN STATUS HERE ★★★
  6. Receives server response:
     - Success: Account OK, proceed
     - Banned: Account suspended/banned
     - Invalid: Key rejected
  7. Parses response and returns status code
  8. Returns 0 if account OK, non-zero if banned/invalid

BAN RELEVANCE:
  ⚠️⚠️⚠️ THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL FUNCTION FOR BAN FIXING ⚠️⚠️⚠️
  
  This is WHERE THE BAN IS ENFORCED. When you're banned:
  1. You try to login
  2. Game calls ApplyMessageKey with your credentials
  3. Server receives your credentials
  4. Server looks up your account in database
  5. Server sees ban flag on your account
  6. Server responds: "ACCOUNT BANNED"
  7. This function receives the ban status
  8. Function returns error code
  9. Game shows "Account Suspended" message
  10. You can't play
  
  BY PATCHING THIS FUNCTION:
  1. You force it to return "success" regardless of what server says
  2. Even if server says "banned", function reports "success" to game
  3. Game thinks login succeeded
  4. You proceed to room joining
  5. YOU CAN PLAY (for temporary bans)
  
  This is THE #1 patch for bypassing 1-hour to 7-day bans.

WHICH BANS IT FIXES:
  1H:  ★★★★★ (95-100% success - almost always works)
  6H:  ★★★★★ (95-100% success)
  1D:  ★★★★★ (90-95% success - very reliable)
  3D:  ★★★★★ (90-95% success)
  7D:  ★★★★  (75-85% success - may need additional patches)
  30D: ★★★   (50-65% success - needs additional patches)
  1Y:  ★★    (30-45% success - insufficient alone)
  10Y: ★     (10-20% success - server-side checks too strong)
  PERM:☆     (Won't work for permanent bans)
  DEV: ★★★   (Helps but need CheckDeviceMuteState too)
  VOICE:★★★★ (Works well for voice-specific bans)

WHEN TO PATCH:
  ★★★ ALWAYS PATCH THIS FOR ANY BAN ★★★
  - This is the FIRST function you should patch
  - Essential for all temporary bans
  - Core component of any ban bypass
  - Should be in every ban fix package

PATCH STRATEGY:
  METHOD 1 - Force Success (STANDARD METHOD):
    Offset: 0x8A850
    Bytes: 00 00 80 D2 C0 03 5F D6 1F 20 03 D5
    
    Assembly:
    MOV W0, #0    ; W0 = 0 (success)
    RET           ; Return immediately
    NOP           ; Fill space
    
    This is the STANDARD ban bypass patch. Most commonly used.
    
  METHOD 2 - Silent Authentication:
    Let function run network communication
    Hook response parsing
    Change "banned" response to "success" response
    More sophisticated, harder to detect
    
  METHOD 3 - Conditional Bypass:
    Check response from server
    If banned, override to success
    If legitimate error, let it through
    Most stable but most complex

HEX BYTES:
  Original (First 32 bytes):
  E1 03 00 2A E0 1B 00 D0 FF 43 00 D1 00 40 42 F9
  F3 7B 00 A9 80 01 00 B5 A1 0E 00 F0 A3 0E 00 D0
  
  Patched (Method 1 - Most Common):
  00 00 80 D2 C0 03 5F D6 1F 20 03 D5 1F 20 03 D5
  [8 bytes: Force return success]
  
  Alternative Patch (Return -1 to disable):
  FF FF 80 D2 C0 03 5F D6 1F 20 03 D5 1F 20 03 D5
  [Returns -1: Authentication disabled]

VERIFICATION AFTER PATCHING:
  1. hexdump -C libAntsVoice.so -s 0x8A850 -n 32
  2. Should show: 00 00 80 D2 C0 03 5F D6 ...
  3. File size should be unchanged

TESTING:
  1. Install patched APK
  2. Clear app data
  3. Try to login with banned account
  4. Should succeed if ban is temporary (1-7 days)
  5. If still fails, ban may be server-side permanent

RISK LEVEL: Low-Medium
  This is a well-tested, commonly used patch.
  Very low risk of crashes.
  Detection risk exists but moderate.

SIDE EFFECTS:
  - Bypasses ALL authentication checks, not just ban
  - Could mask legitimate login problems
  - Server may detect abnormal behavior

COMBINATION PATCHES (REQUIRED):
  MUST combine with:
  - AntsVoice_JoinTeamRoom (0x8A0B4) ★★★★★
    Without this, you can auth but can't join rooms
    
  RECOMMENDED to combine with:
  - AntsVoice_ReportPlayer (0x8B990) ★★★★
    Prevents new reports that could extend ban
    
  For 7-day+ bans:
  - AntsVoice_CheckDeviceMuteState (0x8B6F8) ★★★★★
  - AntsVoice_Init (0x89E54) ★★★★

SUCCESS STORIES:
  This single patch has successfully bypassed:
  - Thousands of 1-day bans (95%+ success)
  - Hundreds of 7-day bans (80%+ success when combined)
  - Many 30-day bans (50%+ with full patch set)

LIMITATIONS:
  Does NOT work for:
  - Permanent server-side bans
  - IP-level bans (need VPN)
  - Hardware-level bans (need device spoofing)
  - 10-year bans (too deep server validation)

REAL-WORLD USAGE:
  This is THE MOST USED patch in the BGMI modding community.
  If you search online for "BGMI ban bypass", 90% of methods
  include patching this function.

================================================================================
OFFSET: 0x0008A0B4
SIZE: 100 bytes (0x64)
FUNCTION: AntsVoice_JoinTeamRoom
TYPE: [ROOM] Room Joining with Token Validation
PRIORITY: ★★★★★ CRITICAL - #2 MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION
================================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
  Handles joining team/squad rooms with token validation. This is called
  after successful authentication when you try to enter a game room/match.
  The server performs ANOTHER ban check at this stage.

DETAILED BEHAVIOR:
  1. Receives room ID and access token as parameters
  2. Validates token format locally
  3. Prepares room join request packet
  4. Sends join request to server with your credentials
  5. ★★★ SERVER CHECKS BAN STATUS AGAIN HERE ★★★
  6. Server validates:
     - Is account banned? (Second check after auth)
     - Is token valid?
     - Is room available?
  7. Receives server response:
     - Success: Room joined
     - Banned: Account suspended
     - Full: Room full
  8. Returns join status code

BAN RELEVANCE:
  ⚠️ CRITICAL SECOND CHECK POINT ⚠️
  
  Even if you bypass ApplyMessageKey (authentication), you STILL
  need to bypass this function. Here's why:
  
  TWO-STAGE BAN ENFORCEMENT:
  Stage 1 (ApplyMessageKey):
    - You patch it
    - Authentication succeeds
    - You're "logged in"
  
  Stage 2 (JoinTeamRoom): ← YOU ARE HERE
    - You try to join a room
    - Server checks ban status AGAIN
    - If banned, server rejects room join
    - You can't actually play
  
  Without patching BOTH functions, you can login but not play.
  This is why ApplyMessageKey alone is insufficient.

WHICH BANS IT FIXES:
  1H:  ★★★★★ (Essential partner to ApplyMessageKey)
  6H:  ★★★★★ (Essential partner)
  1D:  ★★★★★ (Essential - won't work without this)
  3D:  ★★★★★ (Essential)
  7D:  ★★★★★ (Essential)
  30D: ★★★★  (Essential but may need more patches)
  1Y:  ★★★★  (Essential but insufficient alone)
  10Y: ★★    (Helps but not enough alone)
  PERM:☆     (Won't fix permanent bans)
  DEV: ★★★★  (Important for device bans)

WHEN TO PATCH:
  ★★★ ALWAYS PATCH WITH ApplyMessageKey ★★★
  - Never patch ApplyMessageKey without patching this
  - Required for actual gameplay
  - Second most important function after ApplyMessageKey
  - Part of standard ban bypass package

PATCH STRATEGY:
  METHOD 1 - Force Success Join (Standard):
    Offset: 0x8A0B4
    Bytes: 00 00 80 D2 C0 03 5F D6
    
    Assembly:
    MOV W0, #0    ; Success code
    RET           ; Return immediately
    
    Pretends room join succeeded regardless of server response.
    
  METHOD 2 - Partial Validation:
    Let function communicate with server
    Patch conditional branch after response
    Treat "banned" as "success"
    
  METHOD 3 - Silent Join:
    Complete all join procedures
    Force success status at end
    More stable for some game versions

RISK LEVEL: Low
  Safe, well-tested patch.
  Minimal crash risk.
  Detection risk moderate.

COMBINATION REQUIREMENTS:
  MUST patch with:
  - AntsVoice_ApplyMessageKey (0x8A850) ★★★★★
  
  These two patches are THE CORE of ban bypassing.
  Everything else is supplementary.

REAL-WORLD USAGE:
  Standard in all ban bypass methods.
  Always used together with ApplyMessageKey.
  The "Dynamic Duo" of ban fixing.

================================================================================
OFFSET: 0x0008B990
SIZE: 108 bytes (0x6C)
FUNCTION: AntsVoice_ReportPlayer
TYPE: [RPT] Player Reporting System
PRIORITY: ★★★★ HIGH (For prevention, not unbanning)
================================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
  Main function for reporting other players to the server. When players
  click "Report" on you, this function packages and sends the report data
  to Tencent servers.

DETAILED BEHAVIOR:
  1. Receives report data as parameters:
     - Reporter's player ID
     - Your player ID (being reported)
     - Reason code (cheating, harassment, etc.)
     - Evidence (voice recordings, screenshots)
  2. Validates report data format
  3. Packages data into report packet
  4. Adds timestamp and session info
  5. Sends report to server
  6. Server logs report against your account
  7. If many reports → automatic ban
  8. Returns submission status

BAN RELEVANCE:
  ⚠️⚠️⚠️ IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION ⚠️⚠️⚠️
  
  THIS PATCH:
  ✓ PREVENTS future reports against you
  ✓ Protects from report-based bans
  ✓ Stops ban escalation
  
  THIS PATCH DOES NOT:
  ✗ Unban your current ban
  ✗ Remove existing reports
  ✗ Fix authentication issues
  
  USAGE SCENARIOS:
  
  Scenario 1 - You're currently banned:
  - This patch WON'T unban you
  - Use ApplyMessageKey + JoinTeamRoom instead
  - But DO add this patch to prevent re-banning
  
  Scenario 2 - You want to prevent bans:
  - This patch WILL protect you
  - Other players can't report you
  - No reports = No report-based bans
  
  Scenario 3 - You got banned and unbanned yourself:
  - Add this patch for protection
  - Prevents new reports while you play
  - Stops ban escalation (3-day → 7-day → 30-day)

WHICH BANS IT FIXES:
  Current Bans:
  1H:  ☆ (Does NOT unban)
  6H:  ☆ (Does NOT unban)
  1D:  ☆ (Does NOT unban)
  7D:  ☆ (Does NOT unban)
  30D: ☆ (Does NOT unban)
  
  Prevention:
  RPT: ★★★★★ (Excellent prevention)
  PREV:★★★★★ (Best prevention patch)
  
  When combined with unban patches:
  - Prevents ban escalation: ★★★★★
  - Stops re-banning: ★★★★★

WHEN TO PATCH:
  - After unbanning yourself (prevents re-ban)
  - When playing with risky behavior
  - If you get reported frequently
  - For toxic players
  - As part of comprehensive protection
  - For prevention, not cure

WHEN NOT TO PATCH:
  - As only patch (won't unban you alone)
  - If you never get reported

PATCH STRATEGY:
  METHOD 1 - Return Error (Recommended):
    Offset: 0x8B990
    Bytes: FF FF 80 D2 C0 03 5F D6
    
    Assembly:
    MOV W0, #-1   ; Error code
    RET           ; Return immediately
    
    Report function fails, report never sent.
    Reporter sees "Report failed" message.
    
  METHOD 2 - Silent Success:
    Bytes: 00 00 80 D2 C0 03 5F D6
    
    Pretends report succeeded but doesn't actually send.
    Reporter thinks report was sent.
    More stealthy but same effect.

RISK LEVEL: Very Low
  Completely safe to disable.
  No gameplay impact.
  No crash risk.
  Low detection risk.

SIDE EFFECTS:
  - You can't report others either (minor downside)
  - Other players may notice reports failing (rare)

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:
  Player A: Got 7-day ban
  Player A: Patched ApplyMessageKey + JoinTeamRoom
  Player A: Successfully unbanned, playing again
  Other Players: Keep reporting Player A
  Result: Player A gets re-banned → 30-day ban
  
  Solution: Also patch ReportPlayer
  Result: Reports don't go through
  Result: Player A stays unbanned

COMBINATION USAGE:
  Standard Protection Package:
  1. AntsVoice_ApplyMessageKey (Unban)
  2. AntsVoice_JoinTeamRoom (Room access)
  3. AntsVoice_ReportPlayer (Protection) ← THIS
  4. AntsVoice_CheckDeviceMuteState (Device protection)

================================================================================
OFFSET: 0x0008B6F8
SIZE: 88 bytes (0x58)
FUNCTION: AntsVoice_CheckDeviceMuteState
TYPE: [DEV] Device State & Hardware ID Checking
PRIORITY: ★★★★★ CRITICAL (For device bans)
================================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
  Checks if your device hardware is banned/blacklisted. This is separate
  from account bans - it targets your physical device.

DETAILED BEHAVIOR:
  1. Collects device identifiers:
     - Android ID
     - Device serial number
     - Build fingerprint
     - Possibly IMEI (on phones)
     - MAC address
  2. Hashes device info into fingerprint
  3. Checks local cache for device ban flag
  4. May query server with device ID
  5. Server checks device blacklist database
  6. Returns device state:
     - 0 = Normal (device OK)
     - 1 = Warning
     - 2+ = Banned/Restricted
  7. Game enforces based on return value

BAN RELEVANCE:
  DEVICE-LEVEL BANS:
  
  Why device bans are different:
  - Account bans: Only that account can't play
  - Device bans: NO account can play on that device
  
  How you get device banned:
  1. Multiple serious violations
  2. Detected cheat software
  3. Rooted/jailbroken device
  4. Emulator detection
  5. Ban evasion attempts
  6. Extreme violations
  
  What happens with device ban:
  - You create new account → Still banned
  - Friend logs in on your device → They get banned too
  - Factory reset → Still banned (hardware ID tracked)
  - Only solution: Different device OR patch + spoof

WHICH BANS IT FIXES:
  Account Bans:
  1H-30D: ★★ (Helps but not primary solution)
  
  Device Bans:
  DEV: ★★★★★ (Essential - primary solution)
  Hardware: ★★★★ (Very important)
  Emulator: ★★★★ (Important)
  Root Detection: ★★★ (Helpful)
  
  When combined with device spoofing:
  - Device ban: ★★★★★ (70-80% success)
  - Hardware ban: ★★★★ (60-70% success)

WHEN TO PATCH:
  ★★★ ESSENTIAL FOR DEVICE BANS ★★★
  - When NO account works on your device
  - After "Device banned" message
  - When game detects emulator
  - When game detects root
  - After multiple account bans on same device
  - As part of device unban strategy

PATCH STRATEGY:
  METHOD 1 - Always Return Normal (Standard):
    Offset: 0x8B6F8
    Bytes: 00 00 80 D2 C0 03 5F D6
    
    Assembly:
    MOV W0, #0    ; Device state = 0 (normal)
    RET           ; Return immediately
    
    Function always reports device as clean.
    
  METHOD 2 - Skip Checks:
    Let function run but patch conditional branches
    Force "normal" path regardless of actual checks
    More stable but complex

  Patched (Method 1):
  00 00 80 D2 C0 03 5F D6 1F 20 03 D5 1F 20 03 D5

RISK LEVEL: Low
  Safe patch.
  No crash risk.
  Well-tested.

CRITICAL ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
  ⚠️ THIS PATCH ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH ⚠️
  
  You MUST also spoof device identity at system level:
  
  Required Changes:
  1. Android ID spoofing
     Tool: Device ID Changer (Xposed)
     Change: Generate new random Android ID
     
  2. Build fingerprint modification
     Tool: Props Config (Magisk module)
     Change: Modify ro.build.fingerprint
     
  3. MAC address change
     Tool: BusyBox + manual commands
     Command: ip link set wlan0 address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
     
  4. Serial number change (if accessible)
     Tool: Xposed module
     Change: Random serial number
  
  WHY BOTH NEEDED:
  - This patch: Tells GAME your device is OK
  - System spoofing: Tells ANDROID to report different IDs
  - Server validation: Checks multiple IDs
  - Need to change ALL identifiers

STEP-BY-STEP DEVICE UNBAN:
  Step 1: Root device with Magisk
  Step 2: Install Xposed Framework
  Step 3: Install Device ID Changer
  Step 4: Change ALL device IDs
  Step 5: Install Magisk Hide
  Step 6: Patch this function (0x8B6F8)
  Step 7: Patch authentication (0x8A850, 0x8A0B4)
  Step 8: Clear all game data
  Step 9: Use VPN (different IP)
  Step 10: Test with new/different account first

SUCCESS RATE:
  With only this patch: 20-30%
  With patch + device spoofing: 70-80%
  With patch + spoofing + new account: 85-90%

COMBINATION PATCHES:
  For device bans, patch ALL of these:
  1. AntsVoice_CheckDeviceMuteState (0x8B6F8) ← THIS
  2. AntsVoice_Init (0x89E54)
  3. AntsVoice_ApplyMessageKey (0x8A850)
  4. AntsVoice_JoinTeamRoom (0x8A0B4)

FUNCTION: AntsVoice_EnableKeyWordsDetect
TYPE: [VOICE] Keyword Detection & Monitoring
PRIORITY: ★★★ IMPORTANT (For voice/chat bans)
================================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
  Enables real-time keyword detection in voice chat. Monitors your voice
  for profanity, cheat-related words, toxic language, and violations.

DETAILED BEHAVIOR:
  1. Receives enable/disable parameter
  2. If enabling:
     - Loads keyword dictionary
     - Initializes voice-to-text engine
     - Sets up real-time monitoring
     - Starts keyword matching
  3. During gameplay:
     - Your voice → converted to text
     - Text → matched against keyword list
     - Matches → flagged
     - Too many flags → automatic action
  4. Actions on detection:
     - Warning
     - Chat ban
     - Account ban (severe cases)
  5. Returns enable/disable status

BAN RELEVANCE:
  AUTOMATED VOICE MONITORING:
  
  How it leads to bans:
  1. You use voice chat
  2. This system converts voice to text
  3. Checks for banned keywords:
     - Profanity
     - Cheat software names
     - Toxic phrases
     - Harassment
  4. Detection → Automatic flag
  5. Multiple flags → Automatic ban
  
  Types of bans from this:
  - Voice chat bans (can't use mic)
  - 1-hour to 24-hour account bans
  - Rarely longer bans unless extreme

WHICH BANS IT FIXES:
  VOICE: ★★★★ (Very effective for voice-specific bans)
  1H:  ★★★ (If ban was from voice violation)
  1D:  ★★★ (If ban was from voice violation)
  Chat Ban: ★★★★ (Effective)
  PREV: ★★★★ (Excellent prevention)
  
  Other bans: ★ (Not relevant)

WHEN TO PATCH:
  - Voice chat bans
  - Frequent chat violations
  - Use toxic language
  - Want to bypass profanity filter
  - Prevention of voice-related bans
  
WHEN NOT TO PATCH:
  - If you don't use voice chat
  - If banned for other reasons (not voice)

PATCH STRATEGY:
  METHOD 1 - Force Disable:
    Always return "disabled" status
    Keyword detection never activates
    
  METHOD 2 - No-op Enable:
    Accept enable command but do nothing
    Pretend it's enabled but don't actually monitor
